system analysis and design documents for DriverPass project
## CS 255 Portfolio Submission – System Analysis and Design

### Project Summary
The DriverPass project involved designing a software system for a company that helps students pass their driving tests. The client needed a platform that would allow students to access both online practice exams and schedule on-the-road training sessions. The system needed to be efficient, user-friendly, and supportive of student success.

### What I Did Well
I believe I did particularly well in identifying clear functional and nonfunctional requirements and using UML diagrams to visualize system interactions. My documents were organized, detailed, and aligned with the user's needs.

### What I Would Improve
If I were to revise one part, I would improve the level of detail in the initial business requirements document. Some parts could be expanded with clearer rationale and more polished formatting to better communicate the client’s goals.

### Interpreting User Needs
I interpreted the user’s needs by closely analyzing the scenario and focusing on how each user role (students, instructors, admin) would interact with the system. I prioritized usability and practicality in the design. Considering the user’s needs is critical — if the system doesn’t support their real-world tasks, it fails regardless of technical quality.

### My Approach to Software Design
I approach software design by first breaking down the problem, identifying user roles and goals, and then modeling interactions and data flow with diagrams. In the future, I plan to continue using techniques like use case analysis, activity diagrams, and user feedback loops to ensure that my designs meet both business and technical requirements.
